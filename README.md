# Banking Transaction Fraud Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes banking transaction data to identify **fraud patterns**, understand **customer behavior**, and highlight **risk indicators** that can help financial institutions reduce losses.

The analysis focuses on:
- Detecting fraudulent vs non-fraudulent transactions
- Understanding transaction trends
- Identifying high-risk transaction types and customer segments

Tools used:
- **Power BI** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Excel/CSV** as the data source

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains **1,100 rows and multiple columns**, representing customer transactions, transaction types, amounts, and fraud indicators.

**Note:**  
The dataset was obtained in a **raw and unclean format**, similar to real-world data.

### Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Standardized date and numeric formats
- Filtered irrelevant records
- Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions explored:
- What percentage of transactions are fraudulent?
- Which transaction types are most prone to fraud?
- Do higher transaction amounts correlate with fraud?
- Are certain customer segments more risky?

EDA helped uncover hidden trends before dashboard creation.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Total transactions & fraud count
- Fraud rate percentage
- Transaction amount distribution
- Fraud by transaction type
- Customer risk analysis

## Key Insights
- A small percentage of transactions account for a large portion of fraud losses
- Certain transaction types have significantly higher fraud rates
- High-value transactions show increased fraud probability
- Fraud patterns are not evenly distributed across customers

---

## Recommendations
- Apply stricter monitoring to high-risk transaction types
- Introduce real-time alerts for unusually high transaction amounts
- Segment customers by risk level for targeted fraud prevention
- Improve data validation at the transaction entry stage
